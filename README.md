# Ticket Tracker

## Requirements

1. Should be built in React
2. Each component should manage its own state
3. The components should be generated using a map()

## Extension

1. Add a search by name box
2. Add a select by role dropdown box

## Plan

- Create the components you think you will need (at least an employee component, possibly more)
- Map over the data file below to create the components
- Pass data into them via props
- Use State to handle the increment and decrement of tickets
- Style it however you like, but donâ€™t leave it blank
- Should work on mobile devices
